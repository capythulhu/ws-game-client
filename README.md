# ws-game-server

> This project is intended to be executed along with [ws-game-server](https://github.com/thzoid/ws-game-server).

> This code references the server repository described above as a library. If you intend to customize request and response messages (which, if you're planning to make something slightly cool, you will most certainly have to), you may want to fork both repositories and reference _your_ fork instead.

To run this server application, just do:

```sh
go build
./ws-game-client
```

You can also run:

```
./ws-game-client -help
```

to read more about other flags to be used to set up the client.

Use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move around.
